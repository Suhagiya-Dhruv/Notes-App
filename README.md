#Notes App

*************************************************************************************

##Hello Guys,

I make simple notes to create a website.

I use Hooks in this project so you understand how to work hooks and how to store temper data from hooks.

This website is user-friendly, So use to pray for all users.

You want to create notes, delete notes and update notes. So can do it.

Notes: I did not include the database of this site so you click to refresh the page the all data are removed.

##how to run this project

###### First, you need to download the visual studio code and after the download so simply open this folder and run terminal and type "npm start".
